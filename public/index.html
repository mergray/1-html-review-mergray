<h3>Testimonial</h3>

<q>The most amazing thing about Meredith, though, is that she takes all that pain, all that loss, and <br>
  she turns into drive. Drive to save lives, to make things better. And despite all that she's lost, <br>
  she continues to find joy in her work as a surgeon, as a teacher, as a mother. And she managed to <br>
  share that joy through her spirit of discovery and of possibility and of hope, right in the face <br>
  of darkness.-Jackson Avery</q>
